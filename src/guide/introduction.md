# Introduction to binder.js


### How it works

Binder itself doesn't do too much, the true power under the hood is [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).  
If you're comfortable with Web Components already then great but if not don't worry, this guide assumes no prior knowledge.

### Goals

- Work well with server-side templated HTML
- Not reinvent the wheel; use existing DOM functionality
- Not require a build step
